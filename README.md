# What can you do with this MCP? 

1. You can send the bot to a meeting with "Send a bot to this meeting: <meeting_url>"
2. You can have the bot say something with "Have the bot say <text>", and I will say it in the meeting.
3. You can have the bot send a chat message with "Have the bot send a chat message: <message>"
4. You can have the bot leave the meeting with "Have the bot leave the meeting"

# To-Do List

- [x] Bot joins meeting
- [x] Bot leaves meeting
- [x] Get bot status
- [x] Send speech message (sends audio through the bot)
- [x] Send chat message
- [ ] Get list of active bots

## üéØ What you can do with Claude using this MCP

### Basic Bot Management
1. **"Send a bot to this meeting: `<meeting_url>`"** - Creates and sends an Attendee bot to join any meeting (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams)
2. **"Get me the status of bot `<bot_id>`"** - Returns current status, state, and transcription progress 
3. **"List all my active bots"** - Shows all currently active meeting bots
4. **"Remove bot `<bot_id>` from the meeting"** - Makes the bot leave the meeting

### Advanced Bot Features  
5. **"Make bot `<bot_id>` say 'Hello everyone!'"** - Text-to-speech functionality
6. **"Send chat message 'Hi there!' from bot `<bot_id>`"** - Send chat messages through the bot
7. **"Show this image in the meeting: `<image_url>` using bot `<bot_id>`"** - Display images (Google Meet only)
8. **"Play this video in the meeting: `<video_url>` using bot `<bot_id>`"** - Play MP4 videos (Google Meet only)

### Data Access
9. **"Get the transcript from bot `<bot_id>`"** - Retrieve meeting transcripts
10. **"Get chat messages from bot `<bot_id>`"** - Retrieve all chat messages from the meeting
11. **"Get the recording from bot `<bot_id>`"** - Get download URL for meeting recording
12. **"Delete all data for bot `<bot_id>`"** - Permanently delete recordings, transcripts, etc.

## Combining MCPs 
Combining MCPs leads to powerful workflows. For example, I use the Brave Search MCP alongside the Attendee MCP. When I ask Claude, ‚ÄúWho won the last Roland Garros tournament?‚Äù, it:

1. Uses the web MCP to find the answer online.
2. Pipes the result to the Attendee bot, which speaks the answer back to me

## üöÄ Installation

We will use Claude as an example, but you can use any tool that works with MCPs.

### Clone the repository

```bash
# Clone your fork or the main repo
git clone https://github.com/rexposadas/attendee-mcp.git
cd attendee-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the TypeScript
npm run build

# Link for global use
npm link
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for your Attendee server:

```bash
export MEETING_BOT_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"  # Your Attendee server URL
export MEETING_BOT_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"     # Your Attendee API key
```

Add these to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.) to make them permanent.

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Update your Claude Desktop configuration file at:
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`. after you make the changes, restart Claude 

#### Adjust the `mcpServers` section to include the Attendee MCP server.  Use the direct path for now since that's proving to be the most reliable.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "attendee": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "<path>/attendee-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MEETING_BOT_API_URL": "<attendee-url-here>",
        "MEETING_BOT_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/attendee-mcp` with the actual path where you cloned the repository.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start if you want to run Attendee Locally. 

1. **Start your Attendee server:**
   ```bash
   make build
   make up
   ```
1. **Test in Claude Desktop:**
   - Ask Claude: "What MCP tools are available?"

## üéØ Usage Examples

Once configured, you can use natural language commands in Claude Desktop:

### Creating Meeting Bots

- "Send a bot to this Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij"
- "Join this Teams meeting with a bot: https://teams.microsoft.com/..."

### Managing Bots
- "What's the status of bot bot_abc123?"
